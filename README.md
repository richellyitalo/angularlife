# Angular Life 
Mini Game Angular Life

I made with AngularJs based on this game http://projects.abelson.info/life/<br />

I worked with same rules:
  <ol>
  <li>Any live cell with fewer than two neighbors dies of loneliness.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with more than three neighbors dies of crowding.</li>
  <li>Any dead cell with exactly three neighbors comes to life.</li>
  <li>Any live cell with two or three neighbors lives, unchanged, to the next generation.</li>
  </ol>
